            <h3>Student Comments</h3>
            <blockquote class="comment"><i> I really enjoyed how this course was taught and how organized the lectures were. I appreciated that we got to hear the material through lectures, but then also work in small groups to make sure we understand what we have learned. I also liked how everything was related to the real world and was shown to be applicable outside of the course. It was interesting finding articles and listening to podcasts that applied to what we were learning and helped to understand how these concepts are relevant outside of class. Dr. Check was extremely helpful with questions and feedback which was very beneficial and helped make this course enjoyable. </i>

            <blockquote class = "comment"><i>Dr. Check is an exceptional professor. It is obvious that he is knowledgable and has a passion for the subject. It is also obvious that he cares about the well-being and success of his students. He explains course material in a way that is easy to understand and has created an environment where I feel comfortable asking questions. He also communicates well (quick responses via email and provides meaningful feedback for our assignments)...Overall, I am glad I took this course because I learned a lot, and I am glad I was able to take this class with Dr. Check. I would definitely recommend this course and this professor to future students. </i>

            <blockquote class="comment"><i>I really enjoyed the way this class was taught and learned the most in this class than all of my classes this semester. I am now interested in possibly exploring economics in my time here at UST. I feel confident about what I learned and feel confident using what I learned to understand real life experiences. I enjoyed Dr. Check's teaching style as well. </i>
